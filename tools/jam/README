To build jam for Win32 using VC++:

1. Ensure VC++ is configured to work from command line (must be in your path, etc.).
2. Set the environment variable MSVCNT to the base location of your VC++
    installation (e.g. c:\progra~1\DevStudio\VC). No spaces should be present
    in the path!
2. Run 'nmake' in the ./source directory to build jam0.exe.
