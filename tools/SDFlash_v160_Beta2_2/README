Notes for installing SDFlash:

Unzip and run the self-extracting EXE file. Install into the TI code
composer directory (which should be correct by default if you installed
TI CCS into its default location).

After extraction is complete, copy stdopts.cfg to the .../specdig/sdflash/bin
directory to allow SDFlash to work with the serial port drivers.
