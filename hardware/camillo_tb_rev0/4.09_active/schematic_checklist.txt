Checklist for Schematic

Overall Notes:
    - Done: FIX: Need to make sure there are NO unterminated inputs in reset state
    - FIX: Double check on unused ADC input pins
    - FIX: Review names for all parts/headers in schematic
    - Done: Consider reverse voltage diode on power input

Page 1 Notes
    - TODO

Page 2 Notes
    - Checked all GPIO/SPI headers
    - Bootmode, JTAG headers good
    - Done: FIX: LED names should be A0-A7
    - Check: CD74AC connections
    - Passives, power, ground checked
    - Done: FIX: Add proper names for SPI1, U$4

Page 3 Notes

    - Done: FIX: Add proper names for IC3, JP3, JP2
    - Done: FIX: Remove the connections between 1, 4, 6 on UART_A, UART_B
    - Done: FIX: Finalize the gound issue (protective should be same as signal?)
    - MAX322, RS-232 Connections checked
    - Passives, power, ground checked

Page 4 Notes
    - Done: FIX: add proper values for all decoupling caps
    - Checked all resistor and cap packages
    - Done: FIX: VDD3VFL must be driven by VDD_IO not VDD_CORE
    - Done: FIX: place pullups on SPI RX, TX signals
    - Checked all power/grounds
    - Added extra decoupling caps for VDD_IO
    - Checked oscillator connections
    - Checked all DSP I/Os
    - Verified ADC I/Os
    - Checked resistor/cap values
    - FIX: need to refine crystal load cap values
    - Done: FIX: need to finalize McBsp series terminators

Page 5 Notes
    - Checked all resistor and cap packages
    - Checked all resistor and cap values
    - TESTSEL now connected to ground
    - Added DSP_PLL_DIS header
    - Checked all DSP I/Os
    - Added DSP_XINT header and pullups
    - Done: FIX: add pullups to SCITXDB, SCIRXDB

Page 6 Notes
    - Checked and fixed all resistor and cap packages
    - Done: FIX: Add test pins for McBsp Tx and Rx
    - Done: FIX: terminate unused opamps: DTXOP -> DTXIM, DTXOM -> DTXIP 
    - Done: FIX: codec reset needs to go to header so can be decoupled from system reset
    - Done: FIX: add in values for decoupling caps
    - Done: FIX: add header pin for DCSI and pullup
    - Done: FIX: add additional headers to decouple McBsp RX, TX lines from codec

Page 7 Notes
    - Added shunt DNP resistors across pots
    - Done: FIX: add VMID to headers
    - Added probes to audio inputs
    - Done: FIX: Add series resistors to Codec inputs
    - Done: FIX add optional mid-supply reference source?

Page 8 Notes
    - Added shunt DNP resistors across pots
    - Added probes to audio outputs
    - FIX: biasing of output opamps
    - Done: FIX: add VMID to output headers (to terminate possible unused inputs)
