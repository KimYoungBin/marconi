Prep for Next Meeting (tomorrow)
========================

Have an idea which block you would like to work on:

a) Timer/Interrupts

b) DMA Codec

c) RS-232 Driver

d) SPI

Annoucements
===========

1. Created a new label "Agenda".  It's more like "Proposed Meeting
Agenda" if anything.  It's for discussing what should be on the next
meeting's meeting agenda.  So the title should include the next
meeting's proposed agenda, like the one I've posted one as example for
tomorrow's meeting (Agenda: 09-25-2004).

2. I got an idea on using blogspot to keep everybody updated on what's
everybody been up to so that by the time we meet we have a good idea
what's everybody been up to.  It's also good for documentation later.

To Do List
========

1. Mess around with the following programs:
   a) DSP Tool
   b) MATLAB
   c) C/C++ Review
   d) MS Project

2. Research into Radios specialized for digital signal communications

3. Get list of potential supervisors / advisors

4. Project Scheduling (MS Project)

5. Business Proposal for TI JTAG Tool

System Block Diagram
=================

I gotta pick up visio sometime.  Here is a basic breakdown:

Transfer Side:
- RS-232
- Packet
- Framing for encoding
- Modulate for transfer
- DAC
- Radio

Receive Side:
- Radio
- ADC
- Demodulate for receive
- Framing for decoding
- Packet
- RS-232

Additions:
- Timer/Interrupts
- DMA Codec
- RS-232 Driver
- SPI

Ch.1-6 has to do with modulation/demodulation
Ch.7,12 has to do with framing
