Minutes for Mini Meeting on January 26, 2005

Present: Aaron, Stefan (hence the "mini")

1. Thoughts on Application and Demo of our Wireless Modem:

- The "defined application" must satisfy all three of the following criteria:

(1) Situations where wires between two devices is impossible/impractical (e.g. oil rigs);
(2) Situations where voice cannot replace raw bits/bytes data transfer (e.g. files v.s. talking);
(3) Situations where our wireless modem is much cheaper than other implementations (e.g. satellite link)

2. Strategy to "Conform" with the "Proper Design Process"

(1) Decide how we're going to demonstrate the usefulness of our modem in the FYDP demo day
(e.g.1) Base station sending control signals to remote station in third floor of DC ie. lights, scroll text
(e.g.2) Automatic data collection from remote station to base station

(2) Write an "abstract" exacting the actual purpose of our modem on paper such that it's coherent with our intended demo

(3) Develop technical specs that satisfies the functions described in the abstract
(e.g.) power, bandwidth, delay time, etc
