Meeting Minutes for 09-15-2004 Online Meeting:

Gang needs to get his internet up, quick!  j/k  :)

A few things to do
=============

1. We need to get a list of potential advisors by the end of this
term, so that they won't be taken by the time we find them.  Here are
the "requirements":
- Need to be either i) a UW faculty member (e.g. lab tech, prof,
etc.); ii) in the industry with sufficient technical and engineering
experience.
- Would be nice that he/she is knowledgeable and is available for help
- Be generous with marks :)
- Generally a nice person to talk to

2. Looking at radios for the modem
- Site: http://www.radioworld.ca/frs/frs_cobra.php
- We're considering the PR-145-2
- Would be nice that the radios use UHF/FM with higher output power
(1/2 W should be enough?)

3. External Web Site (for demonstration of our work)
- We'll probably use the skeleton in http://www.sgsolutions.ca/warg/ made by Tom

4. CVS/Subversion Server
- if CVS/subversion is found to be better than gmail, we'll use
CVS/subversion for file posting instead.  Though, gmail will remain in
place for discussions and what not.

Discussions
==========

1. Audio Codec Specs
- We looked at the specs for the audio codec, with 16 bits ADC and DAC and SPI
- Spec is available here: http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tlv320aic11.pdf

2. Practice Soldering Boards
- We're thinking about buying some boards from California for
soldering practice, which has some low pitch chip layouts with various
packaging.
- Each kit costs about $17 bucks USD, comes down to about $25 CAD
- We think it's a good idea -- we'll probably go with it
