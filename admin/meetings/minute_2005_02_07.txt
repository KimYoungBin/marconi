Minutes for Meeting on February 7, 2005

Present: The usual four + Suresh

1. Cleared out course of action with Suresh
  - To Do: Write down brief descriptions on what we have accomplished thus far
  - To Do: Write down a list of questions / info that we need from our client in Sri Lanka
  - What Next: Suresh will talk to Engineers at his end and produce some rough specs for us
  - Point from Suresh: final product will probably not be commercialized, but will be personal item

2. Data Flow Decision
  - Alternative 1: One packet in the data pipe at any given time
  - Alterantive 2: Multiple packets in the data pipe, with each packet with its sync bits and length bits attached
  - Analysis: Alternative 2 will be much faster than alternative 1, and it will not produce much more complications
	if we are careful enough.
  - Decision: alternative 2
  - Details: Each packet will have its own sync and length bits, unencoded, tacked onto the encoded packet of data.
	If there are sync bits detected in the encoded data (ie. false sync signal detected), the decoder in the 
	receiving end will first check if the length field makes sense, and if yes, even if it may be a false packet, 
	it will send it down the data pipe, which will eventually be filtered out by Gang's module because it'll be 
	detected as garbage

3. What's Next In Terms of Scheduling
  - Stefan and Aaron will be working on bringing up the next few boards
  - Gang and Aaron will spend a chunk of time sometime to get up and running with code development
