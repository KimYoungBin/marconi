Hey all,

First off, I think it'll be a good idea to email everybody on each
post to uw.fydp@gmail just to notify them there is a new message here
-- maybe at least for the first few weeks, just to get us into the
habit of checking this email account.

A few things before I post the meeting minutes:

ANNOUCEMENTS
==============

1. uw.fydp@gmail.com
The gmail account is set up.  The account sign in is uw.fydp, and the
password is "orthogonalme" -- I know, it's gay, but I couldn't think
of anything clever as of the moment...  Anybody who has a better idea,
change it and let us know the new one.

To automatically have your new post sorted into according labels, I
set it up such that if you include certain words in the subject line,
it'll be sorted automatically.  So far I have set up four labels:
Tool, Spec, Minute, and Discussion.  If you want to start a
discussion, just post your email with subject line starting with
"Discussion: ", followed by the topic of discussion of course.  Same
thing goes with "Tool", "Spec" and "Minute".

2. This week's to do:
- Read ch. 5 & 6, aim for 7
- A few tasks in the minutes below under "INFRASTRUCTURE"
- Dig in more understanding for ch. 1 to 4

included what I have thus far:

==================================

Hey Stefan, is it easier for you to do it in visio, or have you got
enough on your plate for now?  Let me know.

D. ARM v.s DSP
============

1. ARM

ARM: Characteristics
- Philips
- 32 bits
- 65 MHz
- 54 MIPS
- Flash based
- MAC needs 7 to 8 cycles to complete
- 8 million MACs / 8000 = 1000 MACS / sample

ARM: Advantages:
- GCC (Free)
- Simple architecture
- No wait state by using Flash

ARM: Disadvantages
- Performance (Not DSP level)
- No free IDE, debug tools, simulator
- Hard to buy in low quantities (minimum order 200)

2. DSP

DSP: Characterisitcs
- Texas Instruments
- 150 MHz

DSP: Pros
- much better performance
- "Free" Tools - 90 days trial version, maybe crackable
- have reference codes
- TI Code composer studio
- $30 CAD per chip

DSP: Disadvantages
- Not general MCU
- Risk with tools
- Eval board may costs alot

That's all I have for this week.  If you got more just reply to this
message to have everything in one conversation group.

Thanks all, happy reading and we'll keep in touch.

Aaron
