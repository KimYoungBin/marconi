## Reiteration of Gang's Version
## Someone work on 5 and 6
## Last guy who works on it uploads the good version onto the 391 site
## (ie. over write whatever is up there now)
## Whatever is up there now is just in case we forgot to upload it... :D
Challenges arise when economical and realiable data transmission is required for 
remote areas where wired data transmission is not possible.  Wireless data modems have 
provided a wide variety of applications including autonomous data collection and 
remote area emergency response, all of which requires expensive equipment and channel 
licence fees.  This project develops an economical solution to wireless data 
transmission by using public channel walkie talkies, with the flexibility of upgrading 
to higher power radios.  The transmit module will get the user's input from a standard 
serial interface and outputs the modulated message in the audio frequency through the 
user's choice of radio.  The radio at the receiving end will then demodulate the message
and output it to the modem's serial port.  The modem uses a Digital Signal Processor 
(DSP) to [blab here].  [Advantages here] The highly intergrated design results in an 
economical, flexible, and compact device that can be utilized in remote areas where 
cost and flexibility of implementation is a major concern.

## Gang's Version
It is difficult to transmit and receive digital data in many remote areas
where a wireless data infrastructure is not present.  Installing a satilite
link would require thousands of dollars.  What would a project manager do if
he just wanted to transmit kilo bytes of data and had a very limited budget?  
The answer is the transparent wireless modem! It takes digital user input from a
work station through RX 232 and processes it with an embedded Digital Signal
Processor (DSP), which is then transformed into analog data by an 
audio codec in the modem.  The modem utilizes existing voice radios
and audio bandwidth to transmit and receive analog data, which is transformed 
back into digital data on the receiving end by an audio codec and then processed 
by a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) into a form that can be displayed and understood
by the receiving user.  The highly intergrated design results in a cheap, flexible,
easy to imstall (ie, plug and play), and compact device that can be utilized in parts
of world where cost and ease of implementation is a major concern.
